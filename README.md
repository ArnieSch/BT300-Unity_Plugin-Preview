Hello and thank you for your interest in Moverio. 
We are very excited that you are interested in using Moverio with the Unity Platform. 

Please see the two additional documents for details on how to use the BT-300/350 Moverio Unity Plugin. 
The Install guide will show you how to set up your developer environment in order to properly use the 
Plugin. 

Second, the Developer Guide will actually explain what each component does and how to use them in your own
project. 

Keep in mind that this is a preview version. We would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you could offer. 

You can reach out to us with any comment, question or concern at Moverio_tech@erd.epson.com

We look forward to seeing the incredible apps and games you create.
